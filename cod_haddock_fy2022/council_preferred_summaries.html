<!---A small document to read in and display some model results ---> 
<!---Execute this with:


/* NOTE 1: Now, I need to take the (weighted) average of scenarios 1 and 3.  DONE   */
/* NOTE 2: Cod mort under status quo is a little less than in 2021. Why?  
	Could be a "younger" age structure -- check the NAA from 2020, 2021, and 2022.
	could be the fact that we're using annual data. 
		Added in the graphs about the NAA and length structures

	Slot limit of 23 to 28" for GB cod --
		With open seasons that are the same for private and for-hire.
	
		How to test this out
			Run the model with a 21 to 22" slot limit. Very few fish should be kept.
			The model is coded for \geq the minimum and leq the maximum. So if I want a 23-28" slot, I need to enter the max as 27.9 


ageclass lines for 2020 to 2022.  Take out the age 1's.

<li>The April 2021 catch-per-trip distribution for cod has 33.5% trips with 0 cod, 64.9% of trips with 1 cod, and <strong>1.5% of trips catching 2 or more cod</strong>.  This is really similar to March, 2021 and VERY different from May, 2021 .</li>
<li>May 2021: 39% of trips with 0 cod, 23% with 1 cod, 10.7% with 2, 7% with 3 cod, 3% with 4 cod, and there&rsquo;s a smooth decline typical of a reasonably sampled dataset.</li>
<li>March 2021: 40% of trips with 0 cod, 52.4% with 1 cod, 1.3% with 2, 2.7% with 3 cod, 3% with 10 cod.</li>

<h1><a href="#simulations" id="simulations">Simulations</a></h1>
<!---
1. I'm using the number of choice occasions to calibrate the model so the simulated number of trips matches the actual.  
1. I'm using the "always on" behavior -- if an angler hits their bag limit for a species, they continue to fish but will discard any additional fish of that species, regardless of size.  For months when cod is closed, we set the possession limit to 5 and the minimum size to 100" -- this allows a very small number of trips to take a few cod. For months when haddock is closed, we set the possession limit to 15 and the minimum size to 100". This does the same thing. 
1.  I'm ignoring the Oct1 to Oct 7 cod opening for the for-hire fleet. But I'm also ignoring the Sept 1 to Sept 7 cod closure for the for hire fleet. So, we should look at Sept and October together.
SQ averages scenario numbers 1 and 3.   Scenario 1 is "April open for haddock, open for cod" and Scenario 3 is "April open for haddock, closed for cod."
Whole month of April for Cod and closed for haddock (scenario 4).
Whole month of April for both Cod and Haddock scenario 1.

We are running the status quo and 3 sets of regulations under varying "fall scenarios"

The scenarios numbers are ABC
1 cod at 21": B=7
1 cod at 22": B=8
1 cod at 22-28": B=9

Fall season of "1 month": A=4
fall season of 5 weeks: A=5
fall season of 6 weeks A=6

April open: C=0
April closed: C=1
April partially open:C=2

I have to run 3 separate calling files -- 
_OpenSept
_OpenSept5
_OpenSept6
